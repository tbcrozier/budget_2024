# Blake's Budget Plan

### Just try'na figure stuff out

- The goal: 
    - Determine where my money goes
	- Spot outliers & inaccuracies
    - Identify trends and savings opportunities


- Steps:
    - Source the csv data banks (manual process) and deposit in data/sources folder
    - Execute python src/main.py to run the program

What does the program currently do:
    - Reads source files to pandas dataframe
    - Standardizes the columns of different files to one schema
    - Exports standardized dataframe to data/output/standard_df.csv
    
- Future steps
    - SQL to analyze
    - LookerStudio to visualize
